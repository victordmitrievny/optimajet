# Development scripts

## Destination

These are scripts for WFS developers which include scripts for fix database, which appear in the development stage but yet was not release.

After some time I suggest to delete unactual code in scripts. In case of strong need you can find their in git.

## Case Example

Developer Afanasy add new table, but after some time decided to add some new colums in this table, which another developers haven't, but have this table.

## How to use

For convenience add time of fix then comment and code.

## Remember

These scripts are not intended for publishing!
